look we are in a software that we have to build for Cost-of-carry dashboard 

- i already build something using mock data and also implemented XTS

but we dont have api of that also no money to buy it 

- so we doing reverse-engineering on zerodha api to get data 

context : /pyScript/files

- now what i want is we done XTS thing but now i have to change it to what we doing 

/pyScript/files

-but main thing we already have server in this pc if you want to see use docker ps 

so use their postgres db or make new db for data store 

- cause in /pyScript/files we store it in folders and csv 

- also convert it to node for faster and db also 

_FLOW IS_

- remove xts data fetching thing from existing software

- look for how extracting right now /pyScript/files

- convert it into node and push data to db then we can plot chart and all look calculation all thing in app and backedn folder 

- pyScript is for reference
